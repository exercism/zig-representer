# Exercism Zig Representer

The Docker image to automatically create a representation for Zig solutions submitted to [Exercism].

## Run the representer

To create a representation for an arbitrary exercise, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the representer has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/representation.txt` and `<output-dir>/mapping.json`.

## Run the representer on an exercise using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how representers run in Exercism's production environment._

To create a representation for an using the Docker image, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the representer has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/representation.txt` and `<output-dir>/mapping.json`.

## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the representer, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `representation.txt` and `mapping.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `tests/<test-name>/representation.txt` and `tests/<test-name>/mapping.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to generate and commit a new `tests/<test-name>/representation.txt` and `tests/<test-name>/mapping.json` file.
